## Introduction

Fork of the [original LED-Lightpainter project](https://github.com/TheMasterFX/LED-Lightpainter)

**Changes:**

- With the current PlatformIO version, it runs out of the box. No need to manually install libs. Just git clone and run it.
- Added setting for brightness
- Added duration to the home screen, so you know what exposure time to dial in on your camera
- Added max current to the home screen. My setup only allows 3A max, so this info was important for me.
- "Improved" UI a little
